> In my free time I enjoy drawing and taking pictures around Stockholm with my reflex. Here you can find some of my sketches/photos with an associated spotify link to the song that I was listening the most while drawing or walking around the city. I mainly take inspiration from movie scenes ...  maybe you will guess some of them.
