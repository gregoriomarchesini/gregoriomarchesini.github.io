I am supervised by Prof. <a href="https://people.kth.se/~dimos/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dimos V. Dimarogonas</a> (KTH) and Prof. <a href="https://viterbigradadmission.usc.edu/doctoral/faculty-research/profile/?lname=Lindemann&amp;fname=Lars" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lars Lindemann</a> (USC)</p> <p>Mostly guided by a strong passion for mathematics and its application in robotics systems, my main research interests are in <strong>formal methods</strong> for <strong>multi-agent</strong> systems planning and control, <strong>graph theory</strong>, <strong>predictive control</strong> and <strong>robotics</strong>. During my PhD I will develop solutions for multi-agent planning and control under signal temporal logic tasks and sensing constraints. I am currently associated with the <a href="https://www.symaware.eu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SymAware</a> European project. In a world that is more and more pervaded by robotic systems, I wish to contribute in developing more reliable and risk-aware autonomous systems with concrete applications toward a more sustainable future.</p> <p>… That you are here—that life exists and identity, <br> That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.<br><br></p> <p><em>Walt Whitman</em></p> </body></html>
