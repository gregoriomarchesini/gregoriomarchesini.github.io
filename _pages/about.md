I am a Ph.D student at the division of Decision and Control Systems (<a href="https://www.kth.se/is/dcs/division-of-decision-and-control-systems-1.788078">DCS</a>) at **KTH Royal Institute of Techonolgy**, Stockholm, Sweden. I am supervised by Prof. [Dimos V. Dimagoronas](https://people.kth.se/~dimos/) (KTH) and Prof. [Lars Lindemann](https://viterbigradadmission.usc.edu/doctoral/faculty-research/profile/?lname=Lindemann&fname=Lars) (USC)

Mostly guided by a strong passion for mathematics and its application in robotics systems, my main research interests are in **formal methods** for **multi-agent** systems planning and control, **graph theory**, **predictive control** and **robotics**. During my PhD I will develop solutions for multi-agent planning and control under signal temporal logic tasks and sensing constraints. I am currently associated with the <a href="https://www.symaware.eu/">SymAware</a> European project. In a world that is more and more pervaded by robotic systems, I wish to contribute in developing more reliable and risk-aware autonomous systems with concrete applications toward a more sustainable future.
