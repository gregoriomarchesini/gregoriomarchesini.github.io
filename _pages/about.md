 I am a Ph.D student in the division of Decision and Control Systems (<a href="https://www.kth.se/is/dcs/division-of-decision-and-control-systems-1.788078">DCS</a>) at KTH Royal Institute of Techonolgy, Stockholm, Sweden. I am supervised by Prof. Dimos V. Dimagoronas (<a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH</a>. Stockholm Seden) and Prof. Lars Lindemann (<a href="https://www.usc.edu/">USC</a>, California US) 
Mostly guided by a strong passion for mathematics and its application in robotics systems, my main research interests are in formal methods for multiagent systems planning and control, 
graph theory, nonlinear control and robotics. During my PhD I will develop solutions for multi-agent planning and control under signal temporal logic tasks 
and sensing constraints. I am currently associated with the <a href="https://www.symaware.eu/">SymAware</a> European project. In a world that is more and more pervaded by robotic systems, 
I wish to contribute in developing more reliable and risk-aware autonomous systems with concrete applications toward a more sustainable future. In the coming years, I am motivated to apply my research to autonomous space 
systems where the need for safety-critical control strategies is vital.
<br> <br> <br> <br> 
... That you are hereâ€”that life exists and identity, <br>
  That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.<br><br>
