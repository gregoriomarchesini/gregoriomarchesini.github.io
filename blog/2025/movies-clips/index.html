He never once hidden his problems and he was very outspoken on the problems drugs addiction caused him.</p> <p>The first movie that I watched with him being the main character was probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jumanji</a>, which was cetainly a great deal of fun. But the first time I really saw this actor pushing the limit was in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Poets_Society" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dead Poets Society</a>.</p> <p>While we are all told that our time on this planet is limited, I figured that only a handful of time it happened to me to deeply think about it. This clip certainly gave me one of these moments…</p> <h3 id="you-tube-clip">You Tube clip</h3> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi0Lbjs5ECI" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/vi0Lbjs5ECI/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Watch the video"></a></p> <p>But this movie did not stop to surprise me here… in a moment in which I was also struggling with finding some relevance in putting efforts into performing well in school, in sport and in trying to find a way on what to do next in life. This click made me realize it was all about “contibuting a verse” to this life in which we all play some role. For as little as it can be we should just strive to go where passions lead us…</p> <h3 id="you-tube-clip-1">You Tube clip</h3> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wey8nauEyA4I" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Wey8nauEyA4/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Watch the video"></a></p> <p>Only a couple of years after watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Poets_Society" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dead Poets Society</a> another terrific movie come across my watch list… <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Will_Hunting" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Good Will Hunting</a>. While the movie is all a master piece from the start to the end, I just want to share one of the epic moments in which Robin really gives a wanderful speech that reminded me on the importance of living rather than reading about life. For as many books, stories, quotes, linkedin posts or instagram stories we have watched/listned to, we must live our emotions to the deepest point and we must strive to have our own vision of the world around us, rather then a surrogate version often offered to us.</p> <h3 id="you-tube-clip-2">You Tube clip</h3> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GY3sO47YYo" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/8GY3sO47YYo/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Watch the video"></a></p> <p>I hope this post gave you some insights on what type of movies Robin Williams was able to deliver and I want to leave you with one of my favourite quotes from one of his early stand-up comedies…</p> <blockquote> <p>“We are only given a little bit of madness in life … and if we lose that, we are nothing.”</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="you-tube-clip-3">You Tube clip</h3> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klvLQ-lMfrw" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/klvLQ-lMfrw/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Watch the video"></a></p> </body></html>
