# Main Topic
Planning algorithms for multi-robot systems under spatio-temporal and communication constraints represent an active area of research with a wide range of applications, including rescue missions, timed formation control, patrolling, and coverage of unknown areas.

This project involves exploring different approaches for planning trajectories in a multi-agent setup when the system is subject to various constraints. Methods open for exploration include B-spline optimization, physics-informed neural networks, genetic algorithms, and others. In particular, we will consider set-invariance methods based on the notion of control barrier functions, which allow us to cast constraints into a mathematical form amenable to numerical optimization.

# Requirements

Here is a list of recommended requirements for this project. Above all, however, I consider *passion* for your field of study to be the most important. People from any field or background are welcome to apply.

## Highly Recommended
1. Strong mathematical background in the broad areas of control, systems theory, and robotics.
2. Interest in problems related to multi-agent systems and cooperative control.
3. Good knowledge of Python programming and Git.
4. Ability to pursue ideas and projects independently.

## Optional
1. Familiarity with ROS1 or ROS2.
2. Experience with Unix-based operating systems.
3. Previous experience with robotic platforms.
