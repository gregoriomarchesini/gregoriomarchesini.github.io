# Main Topic
This project consists on developing a simulator using Gazebo and ROS2 for space missions involving inspection of orbiting structues using multiple deputy spacrafts. 

The project will require you to build a solid base of software that can be used as a test bed for planning and control algorithms dedicated to inspecting orbiting structures, like decomissioned specrafts, space stations and so on.

For more details, you can contact me by email at gremar@kth.se.

# Requirements

Here is a list of recommended requirements for this project. Above all, however, I consider *passion* for your field of study to be the most important. People from any field or background are welcome to apply.

## Highly Recommended
1. Strong mathematical background in the broad areas of control, systems theory, and robotics.
2. Interest in problems related to multi-agent systems and cooperative control.
3. Good knowledge of Python programming and Git.
4. Ability to pursue ideas and projects independently.

## Optional
1. Familiarity with ROS1 or ROS2.
2. Experience with Unix-based operating systems.
3. Previous experience with robotic platforms.
